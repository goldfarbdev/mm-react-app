# Assessment

The goal of this project is to use ReactJS capabilities and its paradigms by creating a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

This exercise must be completed within a week. The fully functional code must be uploaded to github. The work must be yours, no other person should be directly or indirectly involved.  After you complete the work please provide us the git hub link where we can download and assess the work.

## Instructions
Inside of [index.html](/index.html), you'll find some starter HTML. You shouldn't need to edit this file at all. Open this file on your computer into any browser to run the project. Make sure that [script.js](/script.js) and [styles.css](/styles.css)
are in the same local directory. With the file open in your browser, you should see a `New TODO` button, which `alert`s when clicked. Your goal will be to get this button to create new TODOs.

Inside [styles.css](/styles.css), you'll find some pre-written CSS for your convenience. You shouldn't need to edit this file at all, but feel free to if desired.

[script.js](/script.js) is where most of your work will be done. There is some starter code for you in the file. The `classNames` variable can be used to link any elements you create in js with the associated CSS class names. The next 3 lines of code are the HTML elements that you'll need to update when creating new
TODOs. Lastly, you'll see the `addTodo()` function. This gets executed when creating a new TODO. You should replace the `alert()` call with logic to create new TODOs.
Reminder: The above work needs to be done using ReactJS


Good luck!

## Challenge! (Not Required)
If you finish early and are up for a challenge, try adding delete functionality. This should be in the form of a button within each TODO that removes that TODO when clicked.

##

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
